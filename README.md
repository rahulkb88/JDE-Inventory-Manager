# JDE-Inventory-Manager
This is a chrome extension which I created as part of JDE ideathon. 

Using this extension, the frequently used items and group of items (bucket) were stored in locally and could be directly added to grids of JDE EnterpriseOne applications.

You have to add the items once to the grid. You can also create bucket where you can store multiple items together. Once done, you can open JDE apps like Sales Order or Purchase order and drop these items/buckets.
